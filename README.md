# 📱 BlueAssist

**Efficient Attendance & Field Work Tracking for Modern Teams.**

> **🎓 Note:** This project was developed during my early years as a Computer Science student. It represents one of my first explorations into mobile development with React Native, solving real-world problems with accessible tools.

BlueAssist is a robust mobile application built with React Native (Expo) designed to streamline employee attendance and technical visit logging. It leverages Google Sheets as a lightweight, accessible database, making it a perfect solution for businesses needing a cost-effective real-time tracking system.
